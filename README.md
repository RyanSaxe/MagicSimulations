# MagicSimulations

This repository will contain simulations for answering questions about Magic: the Gathering. 

The `src` folder contains the necessary objects for creating simulations.

The `sims` folder contains scripts built from `src` objects for running simulations.

Documentation for `src` coming soon.

### TODO

1. Integrate with card API (e.g. Scryfall or MTGJSON) to enable dynamic card programming
2. Develop set of base class extensions for common simulation scenarios
3. Develop useful functions such as computing if a card is castable given the lands on the battlefield
3. Create more simulations (always on this list :D)
